						<li class="bold top">Botnets:</li>
						<p class="top">
						This is a collection of software robots, or 'bots' that creates an army of infected computers 
						(known as zombies) that are remotely controlled by the originator. They can send spam emails,
						spread malware, use the computer as part of a DDOS, etc.
						</p>
						
						<img id="botnet-image" src="assets/botnet.png"/>
						
						<li class="bold">DDOS:</li>
						<p class="top">
						Distributed Denial of Service. This is where a server or network is overloaded with requests from 
						machines (sometimes a botnet). The network is flooded with useless information that has to be 
						processed, slowing down the service and sometimes causing it to come to a complete stop because
						the server can only handle a finite number of requests.
						</p>
						
						<img id="ddos-image" src="assets/ddos.png"/>
						
						<li class="bold">Malware:</li>
						<p class="top">
						Malicious software that infects the computer. It takes the forms of viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware
						and adware. They can do things like re-format your hard-drive, alter or delete file, steal sensitive
						information, etc. (a worm differs from a virus because while the virus multiplies quickly to remove 
						data, the worm slowly moves through the system).
						</p>
						
						<li class="bold">Pharming:</li>
						<p class="top">
							Pharming is where a website is stolen to build a fake version. The hacker then sends a threat 
							with a link to the website which makes the user enter their details, which can be stolen by the hacker. 
							This is often done with businesses such as banks.
						</p>
						
						<li class="bold">Phishing:</li>
						<p class="top">
							Phishing is where fake emails, texts, website, etc. are used to look like authentic companies. 
							They're used by criminals to manipulate personal information from the user.
						</p>
						
						<li class="bold">Hacking:</li>
						<p class="top">
							The process which criminals gain access to your computer. They can find weaknesses in pre-existing 
							or zero day bugs in the user's computer and exploit them to gain access to the user's private data, 
							and gain access rights enabling them to install a Trojan or other malware.
						</p>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<!-- Threats -->
				<div class="col-xs-6">
					<ul class="body-text">
						<li class="bold top">Firewall:</li>
						<p class="top">
							A firewall is software or hardware that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic of 
							the computer. Using predetermined security rules, the firewall can block and allow certain connections.
							<br/><br/>
							
							Firewalls are usually used as a barrier between trusted networks and untrusted networks. An example of 
							this would be a firewall between the user's system on a LAN and their connection to the internet. There 
							can be host or network firewalls. Network firewalls filter traffic between two or more networks while 
							host firewalls control traffic in host computers.
						</p>
						
						<img id="firewall-image" src="assets/firewall.jpg">
						
						<li class="bold">Proxies:</li>
						<p class="top">
							A proxy is an intermediary server that is placed between the system requesting a connection to the 
							network and the network. This provides anonymity and security for the user because the network traffic 
							is encrypted and only goes to the proxy server which then relays the traffic to its destination. This makes
							it more difficult for a hacker to determine the origin of the connection because the IP is masked and 
							the connection will be encrypted and untraceable.
						</p>
						
						<img id="proxy-image" src="assets/proxy.png">
						
						<li class="top bold">Encryption</li>
						<p class="top">
							Encryption is the act of encoding data to ensure that it cannot be understood by anyone other than the
							intended recipient. The encryption of data can be done using symmetric or asymmetric methods.
